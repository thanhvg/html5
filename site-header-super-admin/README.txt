I'm also using a form of "atomic" css inspired from John Polacek and Tachyons to layout in the markup. Although I think using this way of styling from modifier class is great and I plan to use it for prototyping, there are many issues when you try and integrate this into production without a solid dev ops plan in place. It gets super messy when you need to change the markup.
